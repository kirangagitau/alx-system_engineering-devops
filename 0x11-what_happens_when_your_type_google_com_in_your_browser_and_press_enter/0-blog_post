There are two aspects to the answers:-
A. What the user sees 
B. What remains transparent to the user (Behind the scenes)

WHAT USER SEES.
- On pressing enter the user is given a feedback responce of google dashboard with a google search prompt to begin
searching or surfing the web.


BEHIND THE SCENES.
The first thing is that when I type google.com in my browser, my computer forwards that request to my default gateway which is usualy my router's
ip address. My router then forwards the request to my ISP (internet service provider) from which a recursive DNS resolver is provided. If the DNS
resolver holds the address of specified domain name, it returns the IP address but if not, then the query goes to the root DNS server which sends
the query to second level servers which in turn sends the query to authoritative server. The authoritative server then fetches the DNS record that
resolves the domain to an IP address and the IP address is fed back to my client machine. The IP address will belong to one of google servers most
likely a load balancer server. On obtaining an IP address, my browser initiates a TCP/IP handshake so as to establish a relibale connection with 
the server. The handshake is a three way with step one being the my machine as the client sends a segment with synchronize sequence number (SYN).
The server responds with SYN + ACK (acknowledgement) to the client. The client finaly responds with ACK and this establishes a reliable connection. 

Usually google has several servers for redundancy and so when my request is received it goes to a load balancer that uses a configured load balancing
algorithm to assign my request to a backend server. 

The application server now serves my browser with the google dash board that provides me with search capability. the application  server can read
information from the google database and upon my request it provides me with a search result.
